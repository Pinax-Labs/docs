Pinaxai is an open-source project and we welcome contributions.

## 👩‍💻 How to contribute

Please follow the [fork and pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) workflow:

- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch for your feature.
- Add your feature or improvement.
- Send a pull request.
- We appreciate your support & input!

## Development setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment:
   - For Unix, use `./scripts/dev_setup.sh`.
   - This setup will:
     - Create a `.venv` virtual environment in the current directory.
     - Install the required packages.
     - Install the `pinaxai` package in editable mode.
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Unix: `source .venv/bin/activate`

> From here on you have to use `uv pip install` to install missing packages

## Formatting and validation

Ensure your code meets our quality standards by running the appropriate formatting and validation script before submitting a pull request:

- For Unix:
  - `./scripts/format.sh`
  - `./scripts/validate.sh`

These scripts will perform code formatting with `ruff` and static type checks with `mypy`.
