If you run `pinaxai auth` and you get the error: `CLI authentication failed` or your CLI gets stuck on

```
Waiting for a response from browser...
```

It means that your CLI was not able to authenticate with your Pinaxai account on [app.pinax.tech](https://app.pinax.tech)

The quickest fix for this is to export your `pinax_API_KEY` environment variable. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
export pinax_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

Your API key can be found on [app.pinax.tech](https://app.pinax.tech/settings) in the sidebar under `API Key`.

Reason for CLI authentication failure:

- Some browsers like Safari and Brave block connection to the localhost domain. Browsers like Chrome work great with `pinaxai setup`.
